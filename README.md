# 4nd3r5on/Xray-core

:warning: **The fork is in early development stage so most likely currently working code won't work in next versions.** 

[Original Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core)

This fork is created to make Xray easier to use not just as a tool, but as a framework. The problem with the original Xray-core is that it's hard to extend and default functionality isn't always enough. Statistics for inbounds, for example, returns only Uplink/Downlink and there is no way to add functionality from outside, to collect statistics your way, there is no safe way to get list of users registered on inbound, no safe way to get list of connected users, it's hard to add your own API, no documentation for using Xray-core directly from your code. All those are the problems that I'll try to address in this fork.
